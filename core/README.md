# lv2rs-core: Rust adaptation prototype of the LV2 core library.

This is a safe and idiomatic to make use of the LV2 core library. It goals are to provide an interface that is compatible with hosts written in C and uses an idiomatic API for plugin implementors.

This is a frozen prototype and therefore, development of this crate will not continue here. Further
development continues as [rust-lv2](https://github.com/rust-dsp/rust-lv2).

## Getting started

If you want to get started with LV2, you should start with the [root crate](https://crates.io/crates/lv2rs) and check out the
[book](https://janonard.github.io/lv2rs-book/).
