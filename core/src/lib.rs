//! This crate contains the complete contents of the

//! to make the use of LV2 as idiomatic and safe as possible.

/// Create  lv2 export functions.
///
/// This macro takes a struct that implements [`Plugin`](trait.Plugin.html) and crates the required
/// functions a plugin needs to export in order to be found and used by plugin hosts.
///
/// In order to properly work, it needs three arguments:
/// * The namespace of the `lv2rs-core` crate: You may use this crate via re-exports and
/// therefore, the name of the namespace is needed in order to call the appropiate functions.
/// * The struct type that should be used as the Plugin implementation.
/// * The URI of the plugin. Please note that the URI needs to be a bytes-array and null-terminated,
/// since the C world has to interact with it.
///
/// Example usage:
///     
///     extern crate lv2rs_core as core;
///     use std::ffi::CStr;
///
///     struct MyPlugin {}
///
///     impl core::Plugin for MyPlugin {
///         fn instantiate(
///             _descriptor: &core::Descriptor,
///             _rate: f64,
///             _bundle_path: &CStr,
///             _features: Option<&core::FeaturesList>
///         ) -> Option<Self> {
///             Some(Self {})
///         }
///
///         unsafe fn connect_port(&mut self, _port: u32, _data: *mut ()) {}
///
///         fn run(&mut self, _n_samples: u32) {}
///     }
