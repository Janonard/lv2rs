# lv2rs-urid: Rust adaptation prototype of the LV2 urid library.

This is a safe and idiomatic re-implementation of the LV2 urid library. It provides means to map
URIs to integer numbers, which improves their speed and memory footprint.

This is a frozen prototype and therefore, development of this crate will not continue here. Further
development continues as [rust-lv2](https://github.com/rust-dsp/rust-lv2).

## Getting started

If you want to get started with LV2, you should start with the [root crate](https://crates.io/crates/lv2rs) and check out the
[book](https://janonard.github.io/lv2rs-book/.
