# lv2rs-atom: MIDI message integration for [`lv2rs-atom`](https://docs.rs/lv2rs-atom/).

This crate introduces new atom types for the use with `lv2rs-atom` which add support for the MIDI communication protocol. MIDI is a protocol originally intended to be used synthesizers with different keyboard, but due to use simplicity, it is used now for almost anything that is music-related.
