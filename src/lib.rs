//! A rust re-implementation of the LV2 core library.
//!
//! This crate contains the complete contents of the
//! [LV2 core library](http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core/lv2core.html) with additional constructions
//! to make the use of LV2 as idiomatic and safe as possible.
//!
//! ## Getting started
//!
//! From Rust's side of view, creating an LV2 plugin is fairly simple:
//! * Create a new library crate
//! * Add the following entry to your `Cargo.toml` in order to build a dynamic library:
//!
//!   [lib]
//!   
//!   crate-type = ["dylib"]
//!
//! * Add lv2rs-core as a dependency both in your `Cargo.toml` as well as in your `lib.rs`
//! * Create a struct and implement [`Plugin`](trait.Plugin.html) for it.
//! * Use the [`lv2_main!`](macro.lv2_main.html) macro to export the required symbols.
//!
//! That's it! Although, if you really want to get started, you should check out the
//! [tutorial](http://lv2plug.in/book/) at LV2's website before.

/// Create  lv2 export functions.
///
/// This macro takes a struct that implements [`Plugin`](trait.Plugin.html) and crates the required
/// functions a plugin needs to export in order to be found and used by plugin hosts.
///
/// In order to properly work, it needs three arguments:
/// * The namespace of the `lv2rs-core` crate: You may use this crate via re-exports and
/// therefore, the name of the namespace is needed in order to call the appropiate functions.
/// * The struct type that should be used as the Plugin implementation.
/// * The URI of the plugin. Please note that the URI needs to be a bytes-array and null-terminated,
/// since the C world has to interact with it.
///
/// Example usage:
///     
///     extern crate lv2rs_core as core;
///     use std::ffi::CStr;
///
///     struct MyPlugin {}
///
///     impl core::Plugin for MyPlugin {
///         fn instantiate(
///             _descriptor: &core::Descriptor,
///             _rate: f64,
///             _bundle_path: &CStr,
///             _features: Option<Vec<&mut core::Feature>>
///         ) -> Self {
///             Self {}
///         }
///
///         unsafe fn connect_port(&mut self, port: u32, data: *mut ()) {}
///
///         fn run(&mut self, _n_samples: u32) {}
///     }
