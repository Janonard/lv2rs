       Connect a port on a plugin instance to a memory location.

       Plugin writers should be aware that the host may elect to use the same
       buffer for more than one port and even use the same buffer for both
       input and output (see lv2:inPlaceBroken in lv2.ttl).

       If the plugin has the feature lv2:hardRTCapable then there are various
       things that the plugin MUST NOT do within the connect_port() function;
       see lv2core.ttl for details.

       connect_port() MUST be called at least once for each port before run()
       is called, unless that port is lv2:connectionOptional. The plugin must
       pay careful attention to the block size passed to run() since the block
       allocated may only just be large enough to contain the data, and is not
       guaranteed to remain constant between run() calls.

       connect_port() may be called more than once for a plugin instance to
       allow the host to change the buffers that the plugin is reading or
       writing. These calls may be made before or after activate() or
       deactivate() calls.

       instance: Plugin instance containing the port.

       port: Index of the port to connect. The host MUST NOT try to
       connect a port index that is not defined in the plugin's RDF data. If
       it does, the plugin's behaviour is undefined (a crash is likely).

       data_location: Pointer to data of the type defined by the port
       type in the plugin's RDF data (e.g. an array of float for an
       lv2:AudioPort). This pointer must be stored by the plugin instance and
       used to read/write data when run() is called. Data present at the time
       of the connect_port() call MUST NOT be considered meaningful.

       however plugins MUST NOT rely on a prompt call to run() after
       activate().

       things that the plugin MUST NOT do within the run() function (see

       As a special case, when `sample_count` is 0, the plugin should update
       any output ports that represent a single instant in time (e.g. control
       ports, but not audio ports). This is particularly useful for latent
       plugins, which should update their latency output port so hosts can
       pre-roll plugins to compute latency. Plugins MUST NOT crash when
       `sample_count` is 0.

       Deactivation is not similar to pausing since the plugin instance will be
