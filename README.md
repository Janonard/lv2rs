# lv2rs: Rust library prototype for the creation of LV2 plugins.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Janonard/lv2rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Janonard/lv2rs)

This is a prototype of an idiomatic library empowering you to create LV2-compatible plugins for audio applications with ease.

## What works, what doesn't?

Currently 4 out of 22 [official and stable LV2 specifications](http://lv2plug.in/ns/) are
supported. These are:

* Atom
* LV2
* MIDI
* URID

This is a frozen prototype and therefore, development of this crate will not continue here. Further
development continues as [rust-lv2](https://github.com/rust-dsp/rust-lv2).
